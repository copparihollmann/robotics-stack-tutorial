# Build the full-feature Rocket SoC PLUS a TileLink bandwidth instrument on the system
# bus, for the PYNQ-Z1, at 34.4828 MHz.  MAGIC 0x5A5A0007.
#
# This is build_micrgb_z1.sh plus one peripheral and NOTHING ELSE: same top level, same
# XDC files, same -verilog_define set, same two harts, same microphone, same RGB LEDs,
# same 64 KB inclusive L2, same AXI4-to-AXI3 shim.  The instrument attaches through a
# testchipip SubsystemInjector and has no pins, so src/pynqz2_rocket_top.v is textually
# unchanged and `u_soc` keeps its hierarchy path.
#
# WHY THAT MATTERS MORE THAN USUAL HERE.  The number this bitstream exists to produce is
# a bytes-per-cycle figure that will be compared with MEMORY_HIERARCHY.md's 1.34, measured
# on a different bitstream.  Any other difference between the two designs would be a
# confound.  There is one difference, and it is the thing being measured.
#
# The RGB pin gate is carried over verbatim: this build has the same six package balls and
# the same reason nobody can see them.
#
# NOTE: `vivado -mode batch` exits 0 even when the TCL raised an ERROR, so `set -e` alone
# does not catch a failed build. Each stage is checked for its explicit success marker.
#
#   scripts/build_bw_z1.sh            full build, through to a bitstream
